In this program we will solve nonlinear equations. It uses Secant and Bisection method. The equations that you can solve in this program :

1-x^3-2x-5=0
2-e^(-x)-x=0
3-xsin(x)-1=0
4-x^3-3x^2+3x-1=0

 First you will choose one equation that you want to solve. Then, select the method. If you choose the Bisection method you enter the interval values and tolerance. If you choose Secant method you should enter first two initial value. Program will solve the equations and it will give value for Secant or Bisection method also it will calculate how many iterations each method and write to screen.
